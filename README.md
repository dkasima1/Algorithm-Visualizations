This project was made in order to showcase my ability in working with React, Bootstrap, and Routing. It was also a fun way to visualize various algorithms. People who are learning algorithms for the first time can use my application to conceptually understand what is going on behind the code. This way, their understanding will improve and so will their ability to apply these algorithms to their own situations. 

Installation:

1) Install node package manager (npm)
2) Clone the repository
3) while in the repository, in the command line run 'npm install' which will install all the dependencies.
4) again in the command line run 'npm start'

How to use:
1) Click the drop down of what algorithm you would like to see.
2) Then click the start or sort button.

Currently many of the algorithm visualizations are a work in progress but the way the application is designed is such that it is easily expandable. It also has a smooth interface and routing thanks to React and React-Router. 

Plans for the future:
1) Allow a variable number of items to be sorted given as input by the user.
2) Allow a change of speed in sorting algorithms. 
3) Implement graph algorithms.
